The Weight Tracker App is an Android project I built to help users easily track their weight over time. It includes a login screen, account creation, and a weight log page where users can add and delete entries. The main goal was to create something simple, clean, and actually useful, focused on helping people stay consistent with their health goals. I kept the UI straightforward and easy to navigate so users would not get overwhelmed. I used SQLite to store the data and made sure to validate inputs to avoid crashes. At first, I used to just jump into coding, but this project taught me to plan better, break things into parts, and design with the user in mind. Testing on the emulator helped me catch layout and logic issues early, and one of the trickiest parts was getting the data to display correctly in the log view, but it ended up being one of the best parts of the app. Overall, this project really helped me grow as a developer by showing me the value of planning, user centered design, and writing clean, maintainable code.
